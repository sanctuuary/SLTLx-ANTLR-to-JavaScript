# SLTLx ANTLR to JavaScript

This repository contains a script to convert the SLTLx ANTLR files to JavaScript files
to be used by [APE Web](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE-Web) for an online SLTLx code editor component.

The script in this repository is based on the "[Writing a browser based editor using Monaco and ANTLR](https://tomassetti.me/writing-a-browser-based-editor-using-monaco-and-antlr/)" tutorial.

## Running the script

To run the script, run: `gradle build`.
